#### how to load/save your model:
```
load("mod.rda")
save(mod,file="mod.rda")
```

### 3.Requirement
Complete the following and have EACH member in the group submit the final Rmd and HTML file to Canvas.

1. Choose any Kaggle competition (aside from the Titanic dataset). 

2. If your Kaggle competition/data doesn't have a predefined business question, create one as a group to work towards. 

3. Produce a robust analysis of the data with the following:

    - An introduction to your data. 

    - States the business question you are trying to answer. 

    - EDA (graphical and non-graphical). 

    - Any data transformations. 

    - Modeling building (can build as few or many models you want, just make sure they are appropriate for your data and you can explain their performance using tidyposterior). 

    - Final discussion of recommendations/how the model could be implemented. 

4. Create a GitLab/GitHub project for your group and invite me to it. Create a readme file that explains what you are doing and use issues to assign tasks. 

The report should have a good flow and narrative to it. Explain what you are seeing and how it relates to the problem at. Do not just include code chunks. If you are having trouble structuring the report, remember to check out reports online or try the IMRaD approach (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) that we discussed in class. 

Be sure to triple check your HTML file before submitting. Make sure each group member submits the final product. Every group member will receive the same grade provided that I do not receive any negative feedback from other members of the group.
